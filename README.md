# ‚ö° KakaSwap AMM

Kakaswap is a very basic AMM Frontend that allows users to swap tokens and provide liquidity to a UniV2 contracts implementation.
It has been developed as a public good to the Kakarot community by [AVNU team ‚ù§Ô∏è](https://www.avnu.fi/).

# üìã Contracts

Deployed contracts on the kakarot testnet are pure Uniswap V2 implementation without any changes. You can find [here the source code of the core](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core) and [here the source code of the periphery](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery).

For more informations, you can check the [Uniswap documentation](https://docs.uniswap.org/).

## Improvements

A lot of improvements can be done on this project. Here are some ideas:
- Enhanced management of errors and loading states
- Transactions history & details(**Everything is already stored on local storage, only UI needed**)
- Custom tokens importing (liquidity part already accept trustless pools deployments, but a bit more work in UX can be done when importing custom tokens)
- Add more tests (some are already implemented as example)
- Clean duplicate code & make it more readable
- Add more features like staking, farming, etc.
- SEO optimization
- Add more languages
- ...
